# epson-projector-remote

A simple EPSON projector remote via RS232 running on a Particle Photon.

This is not intended to be as exhaustive as openHAB's addon. The plan is to have a small feature set of just powering on and off, as (sadly) more than that is not yet supported by Apple's HomeKit and this small project is just a relais for a [homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) plugin I want to write.
